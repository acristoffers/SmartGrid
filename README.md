This is the code used in the article entitled "Load-altering attack detection on smart grid using
functional observers", which is unpublished as of now.

The simulation took 4 hours on a MacBook Air (2020) and I had to leave it overnight on a MacBook Pro
(2015). However, the script saves the results of many steps, so you can grab my MAT file in the
[Releases page on GitHub](https://github.com/acristoffers/SmartGrid/releases/tag/1) and use it (~5GB).
