This is the code used in the article:

E SOUSA, √ÅLAN C.; MESSAI, NADHIR; MANAMANNI, NOUREDINNE (2022). International
Journal of Critical Infrastructure Protection: Load-altering attack detection
on smart grids using functional observers. DOI: 10.1016/j.ijcip.2022.100518

The simulation took 4 hours on a MacBook Air (2020) and I had to leave it
overnight on a MacBook Pro (2015). However, the script saves the results of many
steps, so you can grab my MAT file in the [Releases page on
GitHub](https://github.com/acristoffers/SmartGrid/releases/tag/1) and use it
(~5GB).
