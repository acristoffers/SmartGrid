function dphi = pg_kuramoto(t, phi, ng, nl, wref, K, H, P, D, gamma, disturb)
    % Represents the ODEs for a structure-preserving model of a power grid as a
    % network of coupled Kuramoto oscillators (see Eqs. 6-7 in Ref. [1]).
    %
    % Inputs:
    %     t     -    Time
    %     phi   -    State vector (size 3*ng+nl)
    %     ng    -    Number of generator buses
    %     nl    -    Number of load buses
    %     K     -    Coupling matrix (square matrix size 2*ng+nl)
    %     P     -    Power generation/consumption (size 2*ng+nl)
    %     H     -    Inertia constants (size ng x 1)
    %     D     -    Damping constants (size 2*ng+nl x 1)
